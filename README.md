# Anticipate the building consumption needs

As global warming due to human activities is now recognized as proven by most of us, several major cities around the world are now trying to act to reduce their impact.

This project will focus on the city of Seattle that target to be a carbon-neutral city by 2050. Thanks to meticulous surveys carried out by city officials in 2016, I will first have a close look at the consumption and emissions of non-residential buildings. Then I will test different regression models to predict them. To go further, I will also evaluate the interest of the "ENERGY STAR Score" for the forecast of emissions.
